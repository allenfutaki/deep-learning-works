# deep-learning-works
This is my personal work in deep learning via Pytorch.
It contains the task of
* Person Re-identification
* Pedestrian attribute recognition
* Classification

with methods of
* Learning rate Warm up
* Cross Entropy with Label Smoothing
* SGDR
* Learning rate Cosine annealing
* Attention Mechanism
