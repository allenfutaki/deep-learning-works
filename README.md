# deep-learning-works
This is my personal work in deep learning via Pytorch.
It contains the task of
* Reid
* Classification

with some training methods of
* [NovoGrad](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11286)
* [GradNorm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02257)
* Cross Entropy with label smoothing
* [SGDR, cosine annealing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03983)

and architecture of
* [RMNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02465)


# dependency
* python 3.6.8
* please check the requirements.txt
